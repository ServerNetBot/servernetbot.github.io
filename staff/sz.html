            Hi, I'm SZ and I'm the person who decided to support this project early on by making it into a project of the Globus Network which greatly helped in
            increasing the number of servers connected, aside from that I'm also the person sho's paying for the bot's hosting.
        </p>

            Aside from that all I can say is that I'm a 19 year old europoor man and I own a <a href="https://discord.com/invite/8Kuu8yQ">discord server</a> where I usually talk
