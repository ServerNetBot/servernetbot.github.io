        </h1>

        <h1>No spam</h1>
        <p>
            Do not spam in any of the channels SNET uses to run, this is a quick way to a blacklist. We don’t tolerate any kind of spam and this may end up being the reason for a chat cooldown,
            and no one wants that [Chat cooldown now exists]
        </p>
        
        <h1>Listen to staff</h1>
        <p>
            This may seem obvious but the sheer amount of people who just don't listen is starting to get insane. You should always be listening to staff.
        </p>

        <h1>No NSFW</h1>
        <p>
            I don’t care about reasoning, just dont send NSFW, you don’t want a link filter making staff have to approve all links do you?
        </p>

        <h1>No Advertising</h1>
        <p>
            We filter most ads out but advertising for your own or someone else's gain is prohibited and you will take punishment. This includes but is not limited to, discord invites,
            youtube channel links, twitch links ext. If you dm advertise anyone on the network you will be removed from it, there is no exemption from this.
        </p>

        <h1>Do not TRY to break the bot</h1>
        <p>
            We value people who can find bugs and other issues but people who intentionally break the bot for no reason are the lowest of the low. Many weeks ago all you had to do was
            remove the bot without warning, and we would blacklist for it. Now it takes a hell of a lot more but we follow the same punishment.
        </p>

        <h1>Dont beg for staff</h1>
        <p>
            The short answer is always no. None of the team members online have any say in staff members in fact staff are only picked off applications and applications only happen when
            they are needed. Think again before begging for it. Also remember before just applying for the badge that there is a lot of responsibility that needs to be taken.
            <a href="forms">Applications are here</a>
        </p>

        <h1>Don’t try to bypass</h1>
        <p>
            Bypassing blacklists is going down a deep alley you don’t want to travel down. Please don’t do it as most methods dont work due to the way the system works.
        </p>

        <h1>Alternate accounts</h1>
        <p>
            We don't mind you using a second or third account unless it's to get past a blacklist or other form of punishment. We also don't recommend this as you won't gain the
            messages on your main account and it will take longer to get the 100 messages required for media ext.
        </p>

        <h1>Pings</h1>
        <p>
            Any attempt to bypass the filter we have against mentions will get your access revoked from the bot. We don't tolerate this behavior and will blacklist on the spot.
        </p>
